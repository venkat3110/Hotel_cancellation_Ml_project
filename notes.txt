machine learning life cycle

1.use case
2.business understanding (collecting data)
3.data finding (cloud,database,stakeholders)

BA and domain expertise talks with each other and provide project to data scientist 
now BA and stakeholders provide data to data engineer it will be received from all sources 
he transform data and provide quality to data and make the same to available for
all ie data analyst.data scientist,business intelligence.


now data scientist will further preprocess (data cleaning + feature engineering) data to create machine learning models.

data engineer-->dataanalyst-->data scientist-->ml engineer will deploy model-->ba analyst-->stake holders
